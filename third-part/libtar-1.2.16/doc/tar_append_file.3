.SH NAME
tar_append_file, tar_append_eof, tar_append_regfile \- append data to tar archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtar.h>
.P
.BI "int tar_append_file(TAR *" t ", char *" realname ","
.BI "char *" savename ");"

.BI "int tar_append_regfile(TAR *" t ", char *" realname ");"

.BI "int tar_append_eof(TAR *" t ");"
.SH VERSION
This man page documents version 1.2 of \fBlibtar\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtar_append_file\fP() function creates a tar file header block
describing the file named by the \fIrealname\fP argument, but with
the encoded filename of \fIsavename\fP.  It then sets the current
header associated with the \fITAR\fP handle \fIt\fP to the newly created
header block, and writes this block to the tar archive associated with
\fIt\fP.  If the file named by \fIrealname\fP is a regular file (and
is not encoded as a hard link), \fBtar_append_file\fP() will call
\fBtar_append_regfile\fP() to append the contents of the file.

The \fBtar_append_regfile\fP() function appends the contents of a regular
file to the tar archive associated with \fIt\fP.  Since this function is
called by \fBtar_append_file\fP(), it should only be necessary for
applications that construct and write the tar file header on their own.

The \fBtar_append_eof\fP() function writes an EOF marker (two blocks of
all zeros) to the tar file associated with \fIt\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUES
On successful completion, these functions will return 0.  On failure,
they will return \-1 and set \fIerrno\fP to an appropriate value.
.SH ERRORS
The \fBtar_append_*\fP() functions will fail if:
.IP \fBEINVAL\fP
Less than \fBT_BLOCKSIZE\fP bytes were written to the tar archive.
.IP \fBEINVAL\fP
Less than \fBT_BLOCKSIZE\fP bytes were read from the \fIrealname\fP file.
.PP
They may also fail if any of the following functions fail: \fBlstat\fP(),
\fBmalloc\fP(), \fBopen\fP(), \fBread\fP(), \fBth_write\fP(), or the
write function for the file type associated with the \fITAR\fP handle
\fIt\fP.
